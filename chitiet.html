                    <p>Bloomberg sources said that Apple's investment of several billion USD to develop its own 5G modem chip for the iPhone by early 2025 still cannot have a commercial product, thereby continuing to make Apple dependent on Qualcomm's 5G modem supply.</p>
                    <p>Apple's plans have now changed, with the 5G modem developed by Apple itself set to be released in late 2025 or early 2026 at the earliest. 2026 is also the last year that the 5G modem purchase agreement between Apple and Qualcomm is in effect.</p>
                    <p>These reports further illustrate the daunting task Apple must undertake in designing a 5G modem for its phones and tablets. The tiny semiconductor must connect easily to hundreds of carriers around the world, must work flawlessly in all weather conditions and environments, and most importantly, the modem’s 5G connection speed must at least be on par with the solution from Qualcomm, one of the leaders in the 5G telecommunications industry for many years.</p>
                    <img src="image/chitiet/4.webp">
                    <p>First of all, the standard Apple M3 chip produces a Geekbench score of 3,076 points in single-core and 11,863 points in multi-core. As for the M3 Max, its Geekbench score of 2,971 points in single-core and 20,785 points in multi-core is almost equal to the M2 Ultra on the Mac Studio (2,692 points in single-core and 21,231 points in multi-core). Of course, this is only a part of the performance evaluation because there are some hardware that Geekbench cannot cover, such as the Media Engine system inside Apple Silicon chips. Therefore, the difference in actual performance depends on the actual usage of the user.</p>
                    <p>The difficulties in creating the tiny 5G modem inside Apple’s phones became public in September, just a day before the iPhone 15 was officially launched. At the time, Qualcomm said it would continue to supply Apple with 5G modems for “the coming years,” meaning Apple’s efforts to build its own modems have yet to bear fruit.</p>
                    <p>With that announcement from Qualcomm, the cooperation relationship between them and Apple, which was supposed to end in 2024, has been extended to 2026.</p>
                    <p>Apple’s journey to develop its own modem chips has been long, arduous, and fraught with difficulties. The first signs of those difficulties began more than five years ago, when Apple began hiring engineers in San Diego, where Qualcomm is headquartered. A few months later, Apple opened an office in the city.</p>
                    <img src="image/chitiet/5.jpg">
                    <p>At the time, Apple and Qualcomm were still in litigation over intellectual property rights and royalties for 5G connectivity technology. That lawsuit was settled in 2019, and since 2020, the iPhone 12 has been released with 5G connectivity support, inside those devices are Qualcomm modems.</p>
                    <p>Just months after settling its licensing dispute with Qualcomm, Apple made it clear that it would abandon Qualcomm as soon as it had its own 5G modem, a move that it followed up with a $1 billion acquisition of what remained of Intel’s modem business. Then, at a company-wide meeting, Johny Srouji, Apple’s vice president of hardware and components, announced that Apple’s modem efforts were in full swing.</p>
                    <p>To help the former Intel engineers, now Apple employees after the billion-dollar deal, Srouji hired hundreds of wireless technology experts, including former employees of Qualcomm and MediaTek. Initially, Apple believed it could put its own 5G modem into the iPhone in 2024. This project, internally called Sinope, was expected by Apple leaders when the new iPhone SE version was launched in 2024, including a test of Apple's own 5G modem.</p>
                    <img src="image/chitiet/6.webp">
                    <p>The reason it is called a test is because the iPhone SE is a low-cost version that is rarely updated, with a new version released every few years, and sales are low, unlike the iPhone versions released annually. More importantly, iPhone SE users choose this device because of the price, not because of the technology equipped inside. Therefore, the iPhone SE is the perfect and safe platform for Apple to test their new research results, which are first introduced in a commercial product.</p>
                    <p>However, the modem is still one of the most important parts of a phone. If it does not work perfectly, even the most basic function of a smartphone, such as making calls, will be affected, and the Internet will be unstable. If this modem does not work as expected by Apple, it will surely be remembered as one of the biggest failures of Tim Cook's career at Apple.</p>
                    <p>That’s something Apple really wants to avoid. When Apple reached a new deal with Qualcomm in September, it was reported that the fourth-generation iPhone SE would be delayed from 2024 to 2025. Now, the platform for testing Apple’s new 5G modem may not be available until 2026.</p>
                    <p>As for Qualcomm, even if Apple finishes making 5G modems, in 2026, there will still be iPhone 18 models equipped with Qualcomm modems, more precisely about 20% of total assembled device sales, according to the expectation of Qualcomm's CFO, Akash Palkhiwala.</p>
                    <img src="image/chitiet/7.webp">
                    <p>Apple’s plan is to eventually bring its own modems to the iPad and Apple Watch, after they appear on new generations of iPhones. Initially, the first product of the Sinope project will be a separate modem chip on the iPhone’s motherboard. But at the moment, Apple is also looking to put the modem chip on the A series chip die to save space on the motherboard. At the same time, they are also designing WiFi and Bluetooth transceiver chips so that in the next few years they can replace the Broadcom solution, which is currently present in almost all Apple products.</p>
                    <p>Of course, the effort to develop 5G telecommunications modems remains one of the most demanding projects at the moment.</p>
                    <p>This project required not only the efforts of the hardware and telecommunications component development engineers, but also the help of the device hardware development team and the software programmers who wrote the lines of code that made the modem work.</p>
